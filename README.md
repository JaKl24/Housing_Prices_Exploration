# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization with Python

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **visualization** on a dataset from a Kaggle competition focused on advanced regression techniques. My personal goal is to analyze the dataset and identify the most influential features affecting house sale prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from the Kaggle competition: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview/$citation). The dataset is NOT included in the repo!

It contains various features related to residential homes, such as:
- Lot size
- Number of rooms
- Year built
- Overall quality
- Neighborhood
- And many more...
